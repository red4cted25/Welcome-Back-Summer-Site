## Development Process

This project was developed with the following goals:

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** JavaScript/jQuery was used to add interactivity, such as the swaying palm trees and the flip cards in the activities section.
- **Best Practices:** Code comments, modular SCSS, and semantic HTML tags were used to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

During development, I encountered several challenges, especially since this was my first project after months of not coding:

- **Positioning Elements:** Ensuring the palm trees moved into view without disrupting the layout required careful CSS positioning.
- **Responsive Design:** Making sure the site looked good on all devices was challenging, especially with scaling images and interactive elements.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring that all features worked seamlessly across different browsers required thorough testing and adjustments.
- **Styling and Customizing Elements:** After months without looking at any CSS or SCSS, I forgot many of the different ways to style stuff and commonly found myself looking up
